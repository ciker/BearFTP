# Local command handler
##### Short and simple tutorial

The syntax of commands for now is
```
[Variable] [Key]
```

The variables are applied locally and saved to a config file after a command is executed. Some variables still require a person to reconnect or a server to restart. For boolean (yes/no) variables use `true` or `false`
## We support next variables right now:

  - Hostname
  - Token
  - Banner
  - Report
  - Ban
  - MaxThreads
  - MaxErrors
